/// Holds the id hash of the session currently making requests on this
/// client. Populated from the gateway `READY` event
/// (`auth_session_id_hash`) and updated by `AUTH_SESSION_CHANGE` when the
/// token rotates. Null until the first READY is received.
///
/// This is the single source of truth for identifying the current session —
/// the REST `AuthSessionResponse.current` flag is unreliable and is not
/// used as a fallback. If READY fails to deliver the hash, that is a
/// server-side bug and should be fixed there, not papered over in the UI.
///
/// Resets to null whenever the auth token changes so a stale hash from the
/// previous account cannot be matched against the new account's sessions
/// during the window between token swap and the next gateway `READY`.
