/// One-shot ledger for route-carried message jump targets.

/// location after the jump has landed, so the trigger is DURABLE while a
/// widget's consumption state is not. Recording consumption here, outside the
/// widget tree, means a rebuild or remount cannot forget it and reapply a
/// stale target.
///
/// Consumption is per (channel, message) and keyed to a navigation INTENT:
/// `ChannelJumpTargetLedger.request` re-opens ONLY the target it names, so a
/// deliberate repeat jump to the same message is honoured while every other
/// target keeps its record. A single slot would erase an earlier consumption
/// whenever the user jumps to a second message in the same channel, which is
/// an ordinary follow-up search and would reopen the stale-refetch loop.
///
/// A route target is suppressed once it is either ACKNOWLEDGED or SUPERSEDED.
/// Those are different states and both are needed: interruption is transient,
/// so an unacknowledged target must stay retryable, but a newer jump in the
/// same channel means the user has commanded something else and the older
/// target must never fire again. Without the second rule a pending target that
/// was never acknowledged yanks the user back off the message they just asked
/// for. Note the deliberate consequence: navigating back to `/A` after jumping
/// to B does NOT re-jump to A, which matches acknowledged semantics.
///
/// Otherwise fails OPEN: a target the ledger has never heard of is honoured. A
/// spurious jump costs one fetch, whereas a spurious suppression silently
/// strands the user on the wrong message.
